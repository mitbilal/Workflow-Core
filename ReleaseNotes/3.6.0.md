# Workflow Core 3.6.0

## Scheduled Commands

Introduces the ability to schedule delayed commands to process a workflow or event, by persisting them to storage.
This is the first step toward removing constant polling of the DB.  It also filters out duplicate work items on the queue which is the current problem the greylist tries to solve.
Initial implementation is supported by MongoDb, SQL Server, PostgeSQL, MySQL and SQLite.
Additional support from the other persistence providers to follow.
